# Advanced Teleport

A teleport plugin for Assetto Corsa, inspired by [Nex's Auto Teleport plugin](https://github.com/NexxonOfficial/ac-auto-teleport) but with wheel, controller and keybind support.

## Indicator

Resize the window to just the top line (or just move it partway off the screen) and put it somewhere useful - the background will fade out and you'll see your current teleport at a glance.

## Installation

To install, download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/regen45t/advanced_teleport/releases) page, then either drag and drop the zip into Content Manager, or copy the AdvancedTeleport folder in the .zip into assettocorsa/apps/lua

Cloning the repo won't work unless you rename the folder (probably will be something like advanced_teleport-main) to "AdvancedTeleport" to match the .lua inside, otherwise Assetto Corsa won't run the code and will just show a blank window.
